		"The spaceport's perfect summons you through comms to the local Ventra office. There, at the bottom of a natural cave almost as deep as the Remnant's vaults, you get debriefed by the perfect and their Ventra aid. After explaining your cover story - soon to be your new reality - and your pretext of being hired by Solar Winds Logistics to meet your target, another Remnant leads you into a dark, earthy chamber. The last thing you see is the flash of a tuning rifle, shifting the weft of some of your gray matter, and the memories within."
