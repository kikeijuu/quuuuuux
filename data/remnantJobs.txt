		"The spaceport's perfect summons you through comms to the local Ventra office. There, at the bottom of a natural cave almost as deep as the Remnant's vaults, you get debriefed by the perfect and their Ventra aid. Together, they explain your cover story and your pretext of being hired by Solar Winds Logistics to meet your target: you are to land on <stopovers>, take a job as cover to meet the target on another planet, and then return to <destination>."

After explaining your cover story - soon to be your new reality - and your pretext of being hired by Solar Winds Logistics to meet your target, another Remnant leads you into a dark, earthy chamber. The last thing you see is the flash of a tuning rifle, shifting the weft of some of your gray matter, and the memories within."
