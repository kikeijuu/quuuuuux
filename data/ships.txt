    # new description
	description "The Nighthawk is the result of pirate modifications increasing a Blackbird's capacity for transportation of lawless individuals and slaves, sacrificing much of the ship's original cargo space. The Nighthawk Custom is a further modification to Nighthawks captured by Private Military Companies, for use in their fleets as personnel transport, scouts, and mobile command posts. Although not a true warship, it is better suited to combat than a Nighthawk or Blackbird despite its light armament."
