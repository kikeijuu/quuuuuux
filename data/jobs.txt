		"Slowing towards the spaceport, air traffic control redirects you to a smaller, more pristine landing pad just out of sight from the your usual fare. The same massive logo is embossed on everything: the pad, the cargo cab approaching your ship, and the lapel on the suit that steps out of it. It feels odd to deliver something so greasy to such a regimented business."
		"Touching down, you send a message to your client informing them that you've landed at their requested pad. They respond immediately, saying that they're right alongside you, and you spend a few fruitless seconds looking for them before realizing your clients are the salivating, window-pressed crew of the ship parked to the left you."

The authorities apologize for the trouble, take your cargo, and hand you a fine."

		"Slowing towards the spaceport, your client sends you encrypted coordinates to a smaller, dingier landing pad far out of sight from the your usual fare. Nothing has any logos or markings. Especially not the large van driving up to your ship. If you didn't realize it before, you can tell now that what you were delivering had nothing to do with fast food. Too late to change course, you complete the transaction, and receive your dirty <payment>."
		"Setting down, you send a message to your client informing them that you've arrived at their requested pad. They do not respond, but you hear a quiet series of taps echoing through your ship, originating from the cargo bay doors. You open them to find a group of masked laborers, who are quick to take the cargo off your hands. A thin, wiry individual with a glossy choker hands you a credit chip as the others leave with your delivery."
		"As you touch down, you find this section of the spaceport to be deserted, except for a small family with a stroller making their way around the landing pads. Slowly, they make their way up to your ship, and one of the children accompanying the stroller whistles loudly. As if on que, a port authority cargo cab arrives to receive your shipment. In short order, you receive your credits as well."

		"The recruits file off your ship as soon as you touch down. Each has a quiet determination in their eyes, but they keep a freindly demeanor as you see them off by the hatch. The last to step off hands you a confirmation code, allowing you to recieve your <payment>."
		"At last, your suffering is at an end. Pumped up with bravado the likes of which you have never seen, the fresh recruits you have been ferrying have accidentally damaged every last panel of your ship over the course of their journey, which they spent the length of partying. Thankfully, a more nervous, reversed recruit among the bunch has helped to keep order on your ship. Reluctant to leave, they place a confirmation code for an allotment of <payment> as their fellow soldiers thunder out into the spaceport. With a quick salute, they step out of the hatchway, and it cycles between you."
