phrase "quxFastFoodEnd"
	word
		"Slowing towards the spaceport, air traffic control redirects you to a smaller, more pristine landing pad just out of site from the your usual fare. The same massive logo is embossed on everything: the pad, the cargo cab approaching your ship, and the lapel on the suit that steps out of it. It feels odd to deliver something so greasy to such a regimented buisness."
		"Touching down, you send a message to your client informing them that you've landed at their requested pad. They respond immediately, saying that they're right alongside you, and you spend a few fruitless seconds looking for them before realising your clients are the salivating, window-pressed crew of the ship parked to the left you."
